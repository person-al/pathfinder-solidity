- updated PoemStructs.sol:
  - now uses one array instead of an array and a map
  - each Node fits into 1 byte, which should save on storage
- no changes to Poem.sol

Created Poem and PoemStructs contracts. They have roughly the same logic, but PoemStructs uses structs to store the graph and Poem packs the struct info into a byte32.
